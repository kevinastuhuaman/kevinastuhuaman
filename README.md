### Hey, I'm Kevin

PM turned builder. Currently at Berkeley Haas (MBA '26), previously at PayPal (AI/ML Observability).

I spend most of my time building [Trackly](https://github.com/kevinastuhuaman/trackly) — a job tracker that monitors 80,000+ jobs across 766 companies. Native apps for iOS, macOS, Android, and web.
